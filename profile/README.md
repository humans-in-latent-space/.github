# Humans in Latent Space

Welcome to the intersection of the humanities and latent mechanics.

We are entering an era of agentic, autonomously acting AI. To remain sovereign, we must move beyond the role of the passive consumer. This blog explores Vectorial Agency: the human capacity to navigate the Latent Space — the mathematical foundation of every Large Language Model — with intent, precision, and technical maturity.

I just started to write my [Substack](https://resonism.substack.com/) about **Resonism**.
**Resonism** is my framework — a synthesis of theory and practice designed to achieve resonance with AI. By resonance, I mean a self-reinforcing, constructive interaction between human intent and machine output.

The conceptual framework of Resonism lives and grows in a dedicated [Github Repository](https://github.com/humans-in-latent-space/vectorial-agency). 
This is an open-source project and an invitation to participate in defining the human place within the Latent Space.

**Avoid Noise, seek Resonance**
